/**
 * 151. Reverse Words in a String
 *
 * Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
 *
 * A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
 *
 * Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.
 *
 * Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: s = "the sky is blue"
 * Output: "blue is sky the"
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s = "  hello world  "
 * Output: "world hello"
 * Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: s = "a good   example"
 * Output: "example good a"
 * Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
