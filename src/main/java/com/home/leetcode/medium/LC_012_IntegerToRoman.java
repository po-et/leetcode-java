/**
 * 12. Integer to Roman (整数转罗马数字)
 *
 * Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
 *
 * Symbol       Value
 * I             1
 * V             5
 * X             10
 * L             50
 * C             100
 * D             500
 * M             1000
 * For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: num = 3
 * Output: "III"
 * Explanation: 3 is represented as 3 ones.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: num = 58
 * Output: "LVIII"
 * Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
