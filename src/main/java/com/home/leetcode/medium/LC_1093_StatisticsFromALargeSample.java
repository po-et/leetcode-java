/**
 * 1093. Statistics from a Large Sample (大样本统计)
 *
 * You are given a large sample of integers in the range [0, 255]. Since the sample is so large, it is represented by an array count where count[k] is the number of times that k appears in the sample.
 *
 * Calculate the following statistics:
 *
 * minimum: The minimum element in the sample.
 * maximum: The maximum element in the sample.
 * mean: The average of the sample, calculated as the total sum of all elements divided by the total number of elements.
 * median:
 * If the sample has an odd number of elements, then the median is the middle element once the sample is sorted.
 * If the sample has an even number of elements, then the median is the average of the two middle elements once the sample is sorted.
 * mode: The number that appears the most in the sample. It is guaranteed to be unique.
 * Return the statistics of the sample as an array of floating-point numbers [minimum, maximum, mean, median, mode]. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: count = [0,1,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
 * Output: [1.00000,3.00000,2.37500,2.50000,3.00000]
 * Explanation: The sample represented by count is [1,2,2,2,3,3,3,3].
 * The minimum and maximum are 1 and 3 respectively.
 * The mean is (1+2+2+2+3+3+3+3) / 8 = 19 / 8 = 2.375.
 * Since the size of the sample is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements 2 and 3, which is 2.5.
 * The mode is 3 as it appears the most in the sample.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: count = [0,4,3,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
 * Output: [1.00000,4.00000,2.18182,2.00000,1.00000]
 * Explanation: The sample represented by count is [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4].
 * The minimum and maximum are 1 and 4 respectively.
 * The mean is (1+1+1+1+2+2+2+3+3+4+4) / 11 = 24 / 11 = 2.18181818... (for display purposes, the output shows the rounded number 2.18182).
 * Since the size of the sample is odd, the median is the middle element 2.
 * The mode is 1 as it appears the most in the sample.
